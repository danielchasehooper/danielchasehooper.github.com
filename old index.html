        main points:
        we're not previewing dynamic behavior despite doing the same for graphic design would be crazy
        we're treating touch like a mouse
        touch can be more powerful than keyboard+mouse
        prototyping tools are either screen based or tranformation based
        the content is the interface
        the ecosystem for pro work on ipad is coming, but the interface may not
        the future is 3d, physical objects
        animation should serve a purpose
        combination of animation, physics and gestures produces physically-based interfaces
        physically based interfaces are more organic for us
        physically based interfaces allow powerful uses

        hover for additional info, definitions, notes, etc
        link to specific paragraphs, copyied to clipboard
        medium version has videos in place of interactivity
        videos on desktop in place of touch interactions

Why you should move that button 3px to the left - why? curiosity
Design for Realtime - what does this mean?
The Three Laws Of Interaction Design - seems practical, easily read
